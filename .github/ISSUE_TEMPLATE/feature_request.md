**Feature Description**
- A clear and concise description of what issue is occurring.
  - Unlike a bug report, this should be a feature that is working correctly, but needs additional features and improvements to suit your needs.

**Describe the solution/Expected behavior**
- Describe the feature that could solve this shortcoming as well as how you would like to see it implemented.
- Make a clear and concise description of what you expect to happen when the feature is implemented.
- Include use cases and benefits as well as the expected workflow of the feature.

**Screenshots**
- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
- If it is a visual issue where the raytraced version is wrong/different in comparison to the rasterized version, attach a screenshot of the rasterized version for reference. You can view the rasterized version by disabling raytracing (available in debug and debugOptimized builds).
